Despite its small size, the module serves an important role in the network architecture by decoupling service consumers from the specific network locations of service providers.\r\n\r\nThe module acts as a router in the sense of directing components to the appropriate service endpoints, not in the traditional networking sense of routing packets. It leverages configuration data to map service types to their respective nodes, allowing for flexible deployment and potentially supporting multiple protocols as noted in the module's documentation.\r\n\r\n\n\n## Key Characteristics\r\n\r\n- **Service Discovery**: Provides lookup functionality to find network services\r\n- **Configuration-Based**: Uses the system configuration to map service types to nodes\r\n- **Protocol Agnostic**: Designed to support different protocols in the future\r\n- **Simple Interface**: Offers a minimalist API with just two functions\r\n- **Address Filtering**: Supports filtering by address with a wildcard option\r\n\r\n\n\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n### Upstream Dependencies\r\n\r\n- `hb_opts`: For accessing the node configuration\r\n\r\n\n\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\nThe module's implementation is remarkably concise:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\n-module(hb_router).\r\n-export([find/2, find/3]).\r\n\r\n%%% Locate a service in the AO network. This module uses\r\n%%% URLs to locate services, so it can be used to locate\r\n%%% nodes using IP addresses or domain names. This also \r\n%%% allows us to use different protocols later, potentially.\r\n\r\nfind(Type, ID) ->\r\n    find(Type, ID, '_').\r\n\r\nfind(Type, _ID, Address) ->\r\n    case maps:get(Type, hb_opts:get(nodes), undefined) of\r\n        #{ Address := Node } -> {ok, Node};\r\n        undefined -> {error, service_type_not_found}\r\n    end.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe module exports two functions:\r\n\r\n1. `find/2`: A convenience function that calls `find/3` with a wildcard address ('_')\r\n2. `find/3`: The main lookup function that attempts to find a service by type and address\r\n\r\nThe lookup process involves:\r\n\r\n1. Retrieving the `nodes` configuration using `hb_opts:get(nodes)`\r\n2. Extracting the map for the specified service type from the nodes configuration\r\n3. Looking up the node associated with the specified address within that map\r\n4. Returning either `{ok, Node}` or an error if the service type isn't found\r\n\r\nInterestingly, while the function accepts an ID parameter, it doesn't use it in the current implementation (note the underscore prefix in `_ID`), suggesting this parameter is reserved for future functionality.\r\n\r\n### Expected Configuration Structure\r\n\r\nBased on the implementation, the configuration structure expected in `hb_opts:get(nodes)` would look something like:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\n#{\r\n    service_type_1 => #{\r\n        address_1 => node_1,\r\n        address_2 => node_2,\r\n        '_' => default_node\r\n    },\r\n    service_type_2 => #{\r\n        address_3 => node_3,\r\n        '_' => default_node\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere:\r\n- The top-level keys are service types\r\n- Each service type maps to a nested map of addresses to nodes\r\n- The special address `'_'` can represent a default or wildcard node\r\n\r\n\n\n## Integration with Other Subsystems\r\n\r\n### Integration with Network Communication Subsystem\r\n\r\n- Provides service discovery functionality that other communication components can use to locate endpoints\r\n- Likely used by `hb_client.erl` and `hb_gateway_client.erl` to determine target URLs\r\n\r\n### Integration with Core Infrastructure\r\n\r\n- Uses `hb_opts` for configuration access\r\n- Contributes to the system's overall service topology management",
