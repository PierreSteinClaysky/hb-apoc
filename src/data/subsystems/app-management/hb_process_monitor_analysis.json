This module serves as part of the Application Management Subsystem's process control infrastructure, enabling regular execution of remote tasks with tracking and logging functionality.\r\n\r\nThe module creates a coordinated system of three processes: a monitor process that manages task execution, a ticker process that provides timing signals, and a logger process that tracks activity. This design allows for the periodic polling of an external source for tasks that need execution, with configurable rates and cursor-based pagination to handle potentially large result sets.\r\n\r\nAlthough simple in implementation, this module provides a critical periodic execution infrastructure that can be used for maintenance tasks, data synchronization, cleanup operations, and other essential background activities in the HyperBEAM ecosystem.\r\n\r\n\n\n## Key Characteristics\r\n\r\n- **Multi-Process Architecture**: Uses three coordinated processes for monitoring, timing, and logging\r\n- **Configurable Execution Rate**: Supports custom execution intervals through parameters\r\n- **Cursor-Based Pagination**: Handles large result sets through cursor-based pagination\r\n- **Lightweight Process Design**: Uses basic Erlang process mechanics rather than OTP behaviors\r\n- **Activity Logging**: Integrates with the logging subsystem for visibility and debugging\r\n- **Graceful Termination**: Supports clean shutdown with process monitoring\r\n- **Externalized Task Source**: Retrieves tasks from an external source rather than maintaining internal schedules\r\n- **Unidirectional Communication**: Uses simple message passing with no synchronous responses\r\n- **Minimal State Management**: Maintains only essential state for operation\r\n\r\n\n\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n### Library Dependencies\r\n- `timer`: For sleep functionality in the ticker process\r\n\r\n### Upstream Dependencies\r\n- `hb_opts`: For retrieving default configuration values\r\n- `hb_client`: For retrieving scheduled tasks and cursor information\r\n- `hb_logger`: For activity logging and process tracking\r\n- `dev_mu`: For processing retrieved task results\r\n\r\n\n\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\n### Process Initialization\r\n\r\nThe module implements three start functions with progressive parameterization:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nstart(ProcID) ->\r\n    start(ProcID, hb_opts:get(default_cron_rate)).\r\nstart(ProcID, Rate) ->\r\n    start(ProcID, Rate, hb_client:cron_cursor(ProcID)).\r\nstart(ProcID, Rate, Cursor) ->\r\n    Logger = hb_logger:start(),\r\n    Monitor = spawn(\r\n        fun() ->\r\n            server(\r\n                #state{\r\n                    proc_id = ProcID,\r\n                    cursor = Cursor,\r\n                    logger = Logger\r\n                }\r\n            )\r\n        end),\r\n    Ticker = spawn(fun() -> ticker(Monitor, Rate) end),\r\n    hb_logger:register(Monitor),\r\n    hb_logger:log(Monitor, {ok, started_monitor, {ProcID, Rate, Cursor}}),\r\n    hb_logger:register(Ticker),\r\n    {Monitor, Logger}.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation:\r\n1. Provides flexible initialization options with sensible defaults\r\n2. Creates a logger process for tracking monitor activities\r\n3. Spawns a monitor process with initial state including process ID, cursor, and logger\r\n4. Spawns a ticker process that sends periodic signals to the monitor\r\n5. Registers both the monitor and ticker with the logger for activity tracking\r\n6. Logs the initial startup of the monitor with relevant parameters\r\n7. Returns references to both the monitor and logger processes\r\n\r\n### Monitor Server Loop\r\n\r\nThe module implements a simple server loop for the monitor process:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nserver(State) ->\r\n    receive\r\n        stop -> ok;\r\n        tick ->server(handle_crons(State))\r\n    end.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation:\r\n1. Waits for either a stop or tick message\r\n2. Terminates the process when stop is received\r\n3. Processes scheduled tasks when tick is received\r\n4. Recursively continues the server loop with updated state\r\n\r\n### Task Execution Logic\r\n\r\nThe module implements the task execution logic in the handle_crons function:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nhandle_crons(State) ->\r\n    case hb_client:cron(State#state.proc_id, State#state.cursor) of\r\n        {ok, HasNextPage, Results, Cursor} ->\r\n            lists:map(\r\n                fun(Res) ->\r\n                    % TODO: Validate this\r\n                    dev_mu:push(#{ message => Res }, State)\r\n                end,\r\n                Results\r\n            ),\r\n            NS = State#state{cursor = Cursor},\r\n            case HasNextPage of\r\n                true -> NS;\r\n                false -> handle_crons(NS)\r\n            end;\r\n        Error ->\r\n            hb_logger:log(State#state.logger, Error),\r\n            State\r\n    end.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation:\r\n1. Retrieves scheduled tasks using the client API with current process ID and cursor\r\n2. Processes each result by pushing it to a message handler\r\n3. Updates the state with the new cursor position\r\n4. Recursively continues to the next page of results if available\r\n5. Logs any errors encountered and preserves the current state\r\n\r\n### Ticker Process\r\n\r\nThe module implements a separate ticker process for timing control:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nticker(Monitor, Rate) ->\r\n    case erlang:is_process_alive(Monitor) of\r\n        true ->\r\n            timer:sleep(Rate),\r\n            Monitor ! tick,\r\n            ticker(Monitor, Rate);\r\n        false ->\r\n            ok\r\n    end.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation:\r\n1. Checks if the monitor process is still alive\r\n2. Terminates if the monitor is no longer running\r\n3. Sleeps for the configured interval if the monitor is alive\r\n4. Sends a tick message to the monitor after the interval\r\n5. Recursively continues the ticker process\r\n\r\n\n\n## Integration with Other Subsystems\r\n\r\n### Integration with Core Infrastructure\r\n\r\n- Uses configuration options from `hb_opts` for default timing values\r\n- Potentially monitors core system processes for scheduled tasks\r\n- Could be used for system maintenance and cleanup operations\r\n\r\n### Integration with Network Communication Subsystem\r\n\r\n- Retrieves tasks through `hb_client`, which likely involves network communication\r\n- Could be used to synchronize data with remote systems on a schedule\r\n- Might handle retries or other network-related concerns\r\n\r\n### Integration with Logging Infrastructure\r\n\r\n- Extensively integrates with `hb_logger` for activity tracking\r\n- Provides visibility into scheduled task execution\r\n- Logs errors and operational milestones\r\n\r\n\n\n## Additional Observations\r\n\r\n### Concurrency Model\r\n\r\n- The module creates multiple processes without using OTP supervision\r\n- Communication between processes is one-way through message passing\r\n- The ticker process self-terminates when the monitor dies\r\n- This approach prioritizes simplicity over fault tolerance\r\n\r\n### Error Handling Approach\r\n\r\n- Errors from `hb_client:cron` are logged but don't interrupt operation\r\n- The module continues running despite errors, preserving the last known good state\r\n- There's no explicit retry mechanism for failed operations\r\n- This suggests a preference for continued operation over strict consistency\r\n\r\n### State Management\r\n\r\n- The state maintained by the monitor is minimal and focused\r\n- The cursor acts as a bookmark for resuming operations\r\n- State is passed through recursive function calls rather than stored in variables\r\n- This functional approach aligns with Erlang best practices\r\n\r\n### Potential Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Adding OTP supervision for improved fault tolerance\r\n- Implementing more sophisticated error handling and retry logic\r\n- Adding metrics collection for monitoring execution timing and success rates\r\n- Enhancing logging with more detailed information about executed tasks\r\n- Implementing task validation before execution",
