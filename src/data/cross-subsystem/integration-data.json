The architectural elegance derives not just from individual subsystem designs, but from the sophisticated integration mechanisms that bind these subsystems together.",

      "The analysis examines various integration points and cross-cutting concerns within the platform, revealing how the system maintains cohesion despite its distributed, modular architecture.",
      "These mechanisms enable complex behaviors to emerge from simpler components while maintaining system integrity, security, and flexibility."
