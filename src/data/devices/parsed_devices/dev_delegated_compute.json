As HyperBEAM continues to evolve, this delegation capability will likely remain a key component for distributed computation architectures.\r\n\r\n## TO-DO Comments and Incomplete Aspects\r\n\r\nThis module does not contain any explicit TO-DO comments, which suggests it is relatively complete for its intended purpose. However, some aspects that could be considered candidates for future enhancement include:\r\n\r\n1. The error handling is minimal, with limited context about remote computation failures. More sophisticated error handling and reporting could be beneficial.\r\n\r\n2. There's no explicit retry logic for failed remote computations. Adding configurable retry mechanisms could improve resilience.\r\n\r\n3. The module operates synchronously, which could be limiting for long-running computations. Adding asynchronous operation support would enhance flexibility.\r\n\r\n4. There's no caching mechanism for computation results, which could lead to redundant remote calls. Implementing result caching could improve performance.\r\n\r\nThese are not explicitly marked as TO-DO items but represent areas where the module could potentially be expanded or improved in the future.\r\n"
