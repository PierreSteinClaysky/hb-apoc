As described in its documentation, this device \"simply returns a key from the message as it is found in the message's underlying Erlang map\" for non-reserved keys, while providing specialized functionality for a set of reserved keys.\r\n\r\nThe module serves as the default device for basic message operations, handling field access, manipulation, and attestation (signing) functionality. It acts as a bridge between the raw Erlang map representation of messages and the higher-level operations needed by HyperBEAM's messaging system.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this device particularly important is its role in managing message attestations, which are essential for the cryptographic verification chains that HyperBEAM relies on. The module enables attesting (signing) messages, verifying attestations, and managing attestation-related metadata, forming a core part of HyperBEAM's security model.\r\n\r\n## Key Characteristics\r\n\r\n- **Identity Preservation**: Acts as the base device that maintains the underlying map structure of messages\r\n- **Field Management**: Provides operations for setting, removing, and accessing message fields\r\n- **Attestation Handling**: Manages message signing, verification, and attestor metadata\r\n- **Case-Insensitive Access**: Implements RFC-9110 compliant case-insensitive field access\r\n- **Privacy Protection**: Prevents access to private fields via standard APIs\r\n- **ID Generation**: Computes message IDs based on content and attestations\r\n- **Multiple Attestation Support**: Handles messages with multiple signers\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n### Upstream Dependencies\r\n\r\n- `hb_converge`: For message resolution and field access\r\n- `hb_message`: For message format operations and attestation\r\n- `hb_path`: For hashpath generation\r\n- `hb_private`: For private field management\r\n- `hb_util`: For utility functions and ID handling\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\n### Reserved Keys\r\n\r\nThe module handles several reserved keys with special functionality:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\n-define(DEVICE_KEYS, [\r\n    <<\"id\">>,\r\n    <<\"attestations\">>,\r\n    <<\"attestors\">>,\r\n    <<\"keys\">>,\r\n    <<\"path\">>,\r\n    <<\"set\">>,\r\n    <<\"remove\">>,\r\n    <<\"verify\">>\r\n]).\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese keys trigger specific operations instead of simply returning their values.\r\n\r\n### Message Field Access\r\n\r\nThe module implements case-insensitive field access in accordance with HTTP standards:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\ncase_insensitive_get(Key, Msg) ->\r\n    NormKey = hb_converge:normalize_key(Key),\r\n    NormMsg = hb_converge:normalize_keys(Msg),\r\n    case maps:get(NormKey, NormMsg, not_found) of\r\n        not_found -> {error, not_found};\r\n        Value -> {ok, Value}\r\n    end.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis ensures that fields can be accessed regardless of case, which is important for protocol compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Attestation Management\r\n\r\nThe module provides functions for attesting (signing) messages:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nattest(Self, Req, Opts) ->\r\n    {ok, Base} = hb_message:find_target(Self, Req, Opts),\r\n    % Determine attestation device\r\n    AttDev =\r\n        case maps:get(<<\"attestation-device\">>, Req, not_specified) of\r\n            not_specified ->\r\n                hb_opts:get(attestation_device, no_viable_attestation_device, Opts);\r\n            Dev -> Dev\r\n        end,\r\n    % Find device module and attestation function\r\n    AttMod = hb_converge:message_to_device(#{ <<\"device\">> => AttDev }, Opts),\r\n    {ok, AttFun} = hb_converge:find_exported_function(Base, AttMod, attest, 3, Opts),\r\n    % Convert to tabm format and attest\r\n    Encoded = hb_message:convert(Base, tabm, Opts),\r\n    {ok, Attested} = apply(AttFun, hb_converge:truncate_args(AttFun, [Encoded, Req, Opts])),\r\n    % Convert back to structured format\r\n    {ok, hb_message:convert(Attested, <<\"structured@1.0\">>, Opts)}.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function:\r\n1. Identifies the target message to attest\r\n2. Determines which attestation device to use\r\n3. Locates the appropriate attestation function\r\n4. Converts the message to the appropriate format\r\n5. Applies the attestation\r\n6. Converts back to the desired format\r\n\r\n### Verification\r\n\r\nThe module also handles attestation verification:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nverify(Self, Req, Opts) ->\r\n    % Get target message\r\n    {ok, Base} = hb_message:find_target(Self, Req, Opts),\r\n    % Determine which attestations to verify\r\n    Attestations =\r\n        case maps:get(<<\"attestors\">>, Req, <<\"all\">>) of\r\n            <<\"none\">> -> [];\r\n            <<\"all\">> -> maps:get(<<\"attestations\">>, Base, #{});\r\n            AttestorIDs ->\r\n                maps:with(\r\n                    AttestorIDs,\r\n                    maps:get(<<\"attestations\">>, Base, #{})\r\n                )\r\n        end,\r\n    % Verify each attestation\r\n    Res =\r\n        lists:all(\r\n            fun(Attestor) ->\r\n                {ok, Res} = exec_for_attestation(\r\n                    verify,\r\n                    Base,\r\n                    maps:get(Attestor, Attestations),\r\n                    Req#{ <<\"attestor\">> => Attestor },\r\n                    Opts\r\n                ),\r\n                Res\r\n            end,\r\n            maps:keys(Attestations)\r\n        ),\r\n    {ok, Res}.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function:\r\n1. Retrieves the target message\r\n2. Determines which attestations to verify (all, none, or specific ones)\r\n3. Verifies each attestation by executing the appropriate verification function\r\n4. Returns whether all attestations were successfully verified\r\n\r\n### ID Generation\r\n\r\nThe module handles message ID generation with various options:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nid(Base, _, NodeOpts) when not is_map(Base) ->\r\n    % For non-map messages, return the hashpath\r\n    {ok, hb_util:native_id(hb_path:hashpath(Base, NodeOpts))};\r\nid(Base, Req, NodeOpts) ->\r\n    % For map messages, handle attestation inclusion\r\n    ModBase =\r\n        case maps:get(<<\"attestors\">>, Req, <<\"none\">>) of\r\n            <<\"all\">> -> Base;\r\n            <<\"none\">> -> maps:without([<<\"attestations\">>], Base);\r\n            % ... handle specific attestors ...\r\n        end,\r\n    % Find ID device\r\n    IDMod = id_device(ModBase),\r\n    % Get device module\r\n    DevMod = hb_converge:message_to_device(#{ <<\"device\">> => IDMod }),\r\n    % Apply ID function\r\n    {ok, Fun} = hb_converge:find_exported_function(ModBase, DevMod, id, 3, NodeOpts),\r\n    apply(Fun, [ModBase, Req, NodeOpts]).\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function:\r\n1. Handles different types of messages (map vs non-map)\r\n2. Determines which attestations to include in the ID calculation\r\n3. Identifies the appropriate ID device\r\n4. Applies the ID function to generate the message ID\r\n\r\n### Field Manipulation\r\n\r\nThe module provides functions for modifying message fields:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nset(Message1, NewValuesMsg, _Opts) ->\r\n    % Identify keys to set (excluding reserved keys)\r\n    {ok, NewValuesKeys} = keys(NewValuesMsg),\r\n    KeysToSet =\r\n        lists:filter(\r\n            fun(Key) ->\r\n                not lists:member(Key, ?DEVICE_KEYS) andalso\r\n                    (maps:get(Key, NewValuesMsg, undefined) =/= undefined)\r\n            end,\r\n            NewValuesKeys\r\n        ),\r\n    % Identify conflicting keys and keys to unset\r\n    ConflictingKeys = \r\n        lists:filter(\r\n            fun(Key) ->\r\n                lists:member(Key, KeysToSet)\r\n            end,\r\n            maps:keys(Message1)\r\n        ),\r\n    UnsetKeys =\r\n        lists:filter(\r\n            fun(Key) ->\r\n                case maps:get(Key, NewValuesMsg, not_found) of\r\n                    unset -> true;\r\n                    _ -> false\r\n                end\r\n            end,\r\n            maps:keys(Message1)\r\n        ),\r\n    % Update message\r\n    {\r\n        ok,\r\n        maps:merge(\r\n            maps:without(ConflictingKeys ++ UnsetKeys ++ WithoutAtts, Message1),\r\n            maps:from_list(\r\n                lists:filtermap(\r\n                    fun(Key) ->\r\n                        case maps:get(Key, NewValuesMsg, undefined) of\r\n                            undefined -> false;\r\n                            unset -> false;\r\n                            Value -> {true, {Key, Value}}\r\n                        end\r\n                    end,\r\n                    KeysToSet\r\n                )\r\n            )\r\n        )\r\n    }.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function:\r\n1. Identifies which keys to set, excluding reserved keys\r\n2. Handles conflicting keys (already present in the message)\r\n3. Identifies keys to unset\r\n4. Merges the updated fields into the message\r\n5. Removes attestations if necessary\r\n\r\n## Questions and Insights\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n\r\n1. **Multi-signature Coordination**: How does the system handle multiple attestations that might have conflicting requirements or privileges?\r\n\r\n2. **Attestation Device Compatibility**: What ensures compatibility between different attestation devices used for signing and verification?\r\n\r\n3. **Private Field Security**: How are private fields secured beyond simply preventing access through the API?\r\n\r\n4. **Schema Validation**: Is there any validation of message structure, or is that handled at a different layer?\r\n\r\n5. **Field Conflict Resolution**: When setting fields, how are conflicts with existing fields resolved beyond simple replacement?\r\n\r\n### Insights\r\n\r\n1. **Case-Insensitive Design**: The implementation of case-insensitive key access follows HTTP standards, making it compatible with web protocols.\r\n\r\n2. **Pluggable Attestation**: The design allows for different attestation mechanisms through the attestation device system.\r\n\r\n3. **Privacy by Design**: The module systematically prevents access to private fields, implementing a form of information hiding.\r\n\r\n4. **Identity Flexibility**: The ID system can generate IDs with or without attestations, allowing for different identity verification needs.\r\n\r\n5. **Selective Verification**: The ability to verify specific attestations rather than all of them enables more efficient verification workflows.\r\n\r\n## Integration with Other Subsystems\r\n\r\n### Integration with Device and Process Management Subsystem\r\n\r\n- Provides the base device functionality that other devices can extend\r\n- Manages attestations needed for process verification\r\n- Enables device switching through the `device` field\r\n\r\n### Integration with Storage Subsystem\r\n\r\n- Generates message IDs used for content-addressed storage\r\n- Preserves attestations required for verifying stored messages\r\n- Maintains field structure for cached messages\r\n\r\n### Integration with Core Infrastructure\r\n\r\n- Works with `hb_converge` for message resolution\r\n- Uses `hb_message` for format conversion\r\n- Leverages `hb_path` for hashpath generation\r\n\r\n### Integration with Security Infrastructure\r\n\r\n- Implements attestation (signing) of messages\r\n- Provides verification of signed messages\r\n- Manages access to private fields\r\n\r\n## Recategorization Considerations\r\n\r\nThis module is categorized as part of the Device and Process Management Subsystem, which is appropriate given its role as a device implementation. However, it also has significant connections to what might be considered a \"Message and Security Subsystem\" if such a category existed.\r\n\r\nThe module's primary function is as a device that handles message representation and manipulation, which aligns with the Device aspect of the Device and Process Management Subsystem. Its role in attestation and verification is also critical to process management, as processes rely on verified messages.\r\n\r\nWhile it could potentially be recategorized into a dedicated \"Message Handling Subsystem,\" its current categorization is reasonable given the central role of message handling in the device system. The module's focus on providing a device implementation for message operations, rather than just message utility functions, justifies its placement in the Device and Process Management Subsystem.\r\n"
