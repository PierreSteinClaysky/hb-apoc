Sets up the required configuration for the green zone\r\n2. Ensures a wallet (RSA keypair) exists, creating one if necessary\r\n3. Generates a new AES-256 key for symmetric encryption within the zone\r\n4. Initializes an empty list of trusted nodes\r\n5. Stores these elements in the node's configuration\r\n\r\n### Joining a Green Zone\r\n\r\nThe module implements a sophisticated join process that allows nodes to securely enter existing green zones:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\njoin(M1, M2, Opts) ->\r\n    PeerLocation = hb_converge:get(<<\"peer-location\">>, M1, undefined, Opts),\r\n    PeerID = hb_converge:get(<<\"peer-id\">>, M1, undefined, Opts),\r\n    if (PeerLocation =:= undefined) or (PeerID =:= undefined) ->\r\n        validate_join(M1, M2, Opts);\r\n    true ->\r\n        join_peer(PeerLocation, PeerID, M1, M2, Opts)\r\n    end.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe join process has two flows:\r\n1. **Requesting to join** (`join_peer`): When a node wants to join an existing green zone, it:\r\n   - Generates a hardware attestation report\r\n   - Sends the report and its public key to the target node\r\n   - Receives an encrypted AES key\r\n   - Decrypts the AES key using its private key\r\n   - Updates its configuration with the shared AES key\r\n\r\n2. **Validating a join request** (`validate_join`): When a node receives a join request, it:\r\n   - Verifies the hardware attestation report\r\n   - Validates the configuration compliance\r\n   - Adds the new node to its trusted nodes list\r\n   - Encrypts its AES key with the requester's public key\r\n   - Returns the encrypted key to the requester\r\n\r\n### Identity Management\r\n\r\nThe module supports secure identity retrieval and cloning operations:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nkey(_M1, _M2, Opts) ->\r\n    GreenZoneAES = hb_opts:get(priv_green_zone_aes, undefined, Opts),\r\n    {{KeyType, Priv, Pub}, _PubKey} = hb_opts:get(priv_wallet, undefined, Opts),\r\n    case GreenZoneAES of\r\n        undefined -> {error, <<\"Node not part of a green zone.\">>};\r\n        _ ->\r\n            IV = crypto:strong_rand_bytes(16),\r\n            {EncryptedKey, Tag} = crypto:crypto_one_time_aead(\r\n                aes_256_gcm, GreenZoneAES, IV,\r\n                term_to_binary({KeyType, Priv, Pub}), <<>>, true\r\n            ),\r\n            {ok, #{\r\n                <<\"status\">> => 200,\r\n                <<\"encrypted_key\">> => base64:encode(<<EncryptedKey/binary, Tag/binary>>),\r\n                <<\"iv\">> => base64:encode(IV)\r\n            }}\r\n    end.\r\n\r\nbecome(_M1, M2, Opts) ->\r\n    NodeLocation = hb_converge:get(<<\"peer-location\">>, M2, Opts),\r\n    NodeID = hb_converge:get(<<\"peer-id\">>, M2, Opts),\r\n    GreenZoneAES = hb_opts:get(priv_green_zone_aes, undefined, Opts),\r\n    case GreenZoneAES of\r\n        undefined -> {error, <<\"Node not part of a green zone.\">>};\r\n        _ ->\r\n            {ok, KeyResp} = hb_http:get(NodeLocation, <<\"/~greenzone@1.0/key\">>, Opts),\r\n            Signers = hb_message:signers(KeyResp),\r\n            case hb_message:verify(KeyResp, Signers) and lists:member(NodeID, Signers) of\r\n                false -> {error, <<\"Received incorrect response from peer!\">>};\r\n                true -> finalize_become(KeyResp, NodeLocation, NodeID, GreenZoneAES, Opts)\r\n            end\r\n    end.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese functions enable:\r\n1. **Key Retrieval** (`key`): Encrypts a node's private key with the shared AES key for secure transmission\r\n2. **Identity Adoption** (`become`): Allows a node to temporarily adopt another node's identity by:\r\n   - Retrieving the target node's encrypted private key\r\n   - Decrypting it using the shared AES key\r\n   - Updating its local wallet with the target's keypair\r\n\r\n### Configuration Enforcement\r\n\r\nThe module implements robust configuration enforcement for nodes joining a green zone:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nvalidate_peer_opts(Req, Opts) ->\r\n    RequiredConfig = hb_converge:normalize_keys(\r\n        hb_opts:get(green_zone_required_opts, #{}, Opts)\r\n    ),\r\n    PeerOpts = hb_converge:normalize_keys(\r\n        hb_converge:get(<<\"node-message\">>, Req, undefined, Opts)\r\n    ),\r\n    FullRequiredOpts = RequiredConfig#{\r\n        green_zone_required_opts => RequiredConfig\r\n    },\r\n    NodeHistory = hb_converge:get(<<\"node_history\">>, PeerOpts, [], Opts),\r\n    HistoryCheck = case is_list(NodeHistory) of\r\n        true -> length(NodeHistory) =< 1;\r\n        false -> {error, not_a_list}\r\n    end,\r\n    MatchCheck = hb_message:match(PeerOpts, FullRequiredOpts, only_present),\r\n    MatchCheck andalso (HistoryCheck =:= true).\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis enforcement:\r\n1. Extracts the required configuration from the local node\r\n2. Retrieves the joining node's configuration\r\n3. Verifies that the joining node's configuration matches the required settings\r\n4. Ensures the joining node has minimal configuration history\r\n5. Rejects nodes that do not comply with the green zone's requirements\r\n\r\n## Integration with HyperBEAM\r\n\r\n### Integration with Security Infrastructure\r\n\r\nThe Green Zone system integrates with HyperBEAM's security infrastructure:\r\n\r\n1. **Hardware Attestation**: Uses `dev_snp` for hardware-based security attestation\r\n2. **Message Signing**: Leverages `hb_message` for attestation and signature verification\r\n3. **Cryptographic Integration**: Works with `ar_wallet` for RSA key management\r\n4. **Configuration Security**: Uses `hb_http_server` for secure configuration updates\r\n\r\n### Integration with Network Infrastructure\r\n\r\nThe system integrates with HyperBEAM's network infrastructure:\r\n\r\n1. **HTTP Communication**: Uses `hb_http` for secure communication between nodes\r\n2. **Node Discovery**: Supports node location and addressing for green zone formation\r\n3. **Request/Response Patterns**: Follows HyperBEAM's standard request/response patterns\r\n4. **Message Verification**: Verifies message signatures to prevent MITM attacks\r\n\r\n### Integration with Configuration System\r\n\r\nThe system deeply integrates with HyperBEAM's configuration system:\r\n\r\n1. **Required Configuration**: Enforces specific configuration across green zone nodes\r\n2. **Configuration Adoption**: Supports adopting configuration from joining nodes\r\n3. **Configuration Security**: Prevents unauthorized configuration changes\r\n4. **Node Message Integration**: Works with `dev_meta` to manage node messages\r\n\r\n## Testing Approach\r\n\r\nThe module includes testing for critical cryptographic operations:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nrsa_wallet_integration_test() ->\r\n    % Create a new wallet using ar_wallet\r\n    Wallet = ar_wallet:new(),\r\n    {{KeyType, Priv, Pub}, {KeyType, Pub}} = Wallet,\r\n    % Create test message\r\n    PlainText = <<\"HyperBEAM integration test message.\">>,\r\n    % Create RSA public key record for encryption\r\n    RsaPubKey = #'RSAPublicKey'{\r\n        publicExponent = 65537,\r\n        modulus = crypto:bytes_to_integer(Pub)\r\n    },\r\n    % Encrypt using public key\r\n    Encrypted = public_key:encrypt_public(PlainText, RsaPubKey),\r\n    % Create RSA private key record for decryption\r\n    RSAPrivKey = #'RSAPrivateKey'{\r\n        publicExponent = 65537,\r\n        modulus = crypto:bytes_to_integer(Pub),\r\n        privateExponent = crypto:bytes_to_integer(Priv)\r\n    },\r\n    % Verify decryption works\r\n    Decrypted = public_key:decrypt_private(Encrypted, RSAPrivKey),\r\n    % Verify roundtrip\r\n    ?assertEqual(PlainText, Decrypted),\r\n    % Verify wallet structure\r\n    ?assertEqual(KeyType, {rsa, 65537}).\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis test:\r\n1.
