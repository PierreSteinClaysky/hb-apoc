Checks that SNP is not already initialized\r\n2. Ensures the node does not already have an operator set\r\n3. Extracts trusted hashes from the message\r\n4. Stores the hashes in the node's configuration\r\n\r\n### Attestation Report Generation\r\n\r\nThe module generates attestation reports:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\ngenerate(_M1, _M2, Opts) ->\r\n    Wallet = hb_opts:get(priv_wallet, no_viable_wallet, Opts),\r\n    Address = hb_util:human_id(ar_wallet:to_address(Wallet)),\r\n    {ok, PublicNodeMsgID} =\r\n        dev_message:id(\r\n            NodeMsg = hb_private:reset(Opts),\r\n            #{ <<\"attestors\">> => <<\"none\">> },\r\n            Opts\r\n        ),\r\n    RawPublicNodeMsgID = hb_util:native_id(PublicNodeMsgID),\r\n    ReportData = generate_nonce(Address, RawPublicNodeMsgID),\r\n    {ok, ReportJSON} = dev_snp_nif:generate_attestation_report(ReportData, 1),\r\n    LocalHashes = hb_opts:get(snp_hashes, {error, not_configured}, Opts),\r\n    ReportMsg = hb_message:attest(LocalHashes#{\r\n        <<\"nonce\">> => hb_util:encode(ReportData),\r\n        <<\"address\">> => Address,\r\n        <<\"node-message\">> => NodeMsg,\r\n        <<\"report\">> => ReportJSON\r\n    }, Wallet),\r\n    {ok, ReportMsg}.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis process:\r\n1. Gets the node's wallet and address\r\n2. Creates a public version of the node message (without private fields)\r\n3. Generates a nonce using the address and node message ID\r\n4. Calls the NIF to generate an attestation report with this nonce\r\n5. Creates a complete attestation message with the report and supporting data\r\n6. Signs the message with the node's wallet\r\n\r\n### Attestation Report Verification\r\n\r\nThe module verifies attestation reports through a multi-step process:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nverify(M1, M2, NodeOpts) ->\r\n    {ok, MsgWithJSONReport} = hb_message:find_target(M1, M2, NodeOpts),\r\n    ReportJSON = hb_converge:get(<<\"report\">>, MsgWithJSONReport, NodeOpts),\r\n    Report = jiffy:decode(ReportJSON, [return_maps]),\r\n    Msg = maps:merge(\r\n        maps:without([<<\"report\">>], MsgWithJSONReport),\r\n        Report\r\n    ),\r\n    % Step 1: Verify the nonce.\r\n    Address = hb_converge:get(<<\"address\">>, Msg, NodeOpts),\r\n    NodeMsgID = extract_node_message_id(Msg, NodeOpts),\r\n    Nonce = hb_util:decode(hb_converge:get(<<\"nonce\">>, Msg, NodeOpts)),\r\n    NonceMatches = report_data_matches(Address, NodeMsgID, Nonce),\r\n    % Step 2: Verify the address and the signature.\r\n    Signers = hb_message:signers(MsgWithJSONReport),\r\n    SigIsValid = hb_message:verify(MsgWithJSONReport, Signers),\r\n    AddressIsValid = lists:member(Address, Signers),\r\n    % Step 3: Verify that the debug flag is disabled.\r\n    DebugDisabled = not is_debug(Msg),\r\n    % Step 4: Verify measurement data (firmware, kernel, OS image) is trusted.\r\n    IsTrustedSoftware = execute_is_trusted(M1, Msg, NodeOpts),\r\n    % Step 5: Verify the measurement against the report's measurement.\r\n    Args = extract_measurement_args(Msg),\r\n    {ok, Expected} = dev_snp_nif:compute_launch_digest(Args),\r\n    Measurement = hb_converge:get(<<\"measurement\">>, Msg, NodeOpts),\r\n    {ok, MeasurementIsValid} = dev_snp_nif:verify_measurement(ReportJSON, list_to_binary(Expected)),\r\n    % Step 6: Check the report's integrity.\r\n    {ok, ReportIsValid} = dev_snp_nif:verify_signature(ReportJSON),\r\n    Valid = all_checks_pass([\r\n        NonceMatches, SigIsValid, AddressIsValid, DebugDisabled,\r\n        IsTrustedSoftware, MeasurementIsValid, ReportIsValid\r\n    ]),\r\n    {ok, Valid}.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe verification process performs multiple checks:\r\n1. Verifies the nonce matches the expected value\r\n2. Validates message signatures and signing address\r\n3. Ensures the debug flag is disabled (production mode)\r\n4. Verifies all software components are trusted\r\n5. Validates the measurement against expected launch digest\r\n6. Verifies the report's signature against hardware root of trust\r\n\r\n### Trust Verification\r\n\r\nThe module implements a trust verification mechanism:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\ntrusted(_Msg1, Msg2, NodeOpts) ->\r\n    Key = hb_converge:get(<<\"key\">>, Msg2, NodeOpts),\r\n    Body = hb_converge:get(<<\"body\">>, Msg2, not_found, NodeOpts),\r\n    TrustedSoftware = hb_opts:get(trusted, #{}, NodeOpts),\r\n    PropertyName = hb_converge:get(Key, TrustedSoftware, not_found, NodeOpts),\r\n    {ok, PropertyName == Body}.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows verifying individual software components against a list of trusted values.\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details: Native Interface (`dev_snp_nif.erl`)\r\n\r\n### NIF Interface\r\n\r\nThe module defines the interface to native functions:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\n-export([generate_attestation_report/2, compute_launch_digest/1, check_snp_support/0]).\r\n-export([verify_measurement/2, verify_signature/1]).\r\n\r\ncheck_snp_support() -> ?NOT_LOADED.\r\ngenerate_attestation_report(_UniqueData, _VMPL) -> ?NOT_LOADED.\r\ncompute_launch_digest(_Args) -> ?NOT_LOADED.\r\nverify_measurement(_Report, _Expected) -> ?NOT_LOADED.\r\nverify_signature(_Report) -> ?NOT_LOADED.\r\n\r\ninit() ->\r\n    ?load_nif_from_crate(dev_snp_nif, 0).\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese functions provide:\r\n1. Checking if SNP is supported on the current hardware\r\n2. Generating attestation reports with unique data\r\n3. Computing expected launch digests from configuration\r\n4. Verifying measurements against expected values\r\n5. Verifying report signatures\r\n\r\n### Native Implementation\r\n\r\nWhile the actual native code isn't included here (it's likely in a Rust crate), the interface suggests it provides:\r\n\r\n1. **Hardware Access**: Direct access to AMD SEV-SNP hardware features\r\n2. **Cryptographic Operations**: Signature generation and verification\r\n3. **Measurement Computation**: Launch digest calculation\r\n4. **Report Validation**: Attestation report integrity checks\r\n\r\nThe tests in `dev_snp_nif.erl` provide insights into the expected behavior:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\ncompute_launch_digest_test() ->\r\n    ArgsMap = #{ \r\n        vcpus => 1,\r\n        vcpu_type => 5, \r\n        vmm_type => 1,\r\n        guest_features => 16#1,\r\n        firmware => \"b8c5d4082d5738db6b0fb0294174992738645df70c44cdecf7fad3a62244b788e7e408c582ee48a74b289f3acec78510\",\r\n        kernel => \"69d0cd7d13858e4fcef6bc7797aebd258730f215bc5642c4ad8e4b893cc67576\",\r\n        initrd => \"02e28b6c718bf0a5260d6f34d3c8fe0d71bf5f02af13e1bc695c6bc162120da1\",\r\n        append => \"56e1e5190622c8c6b9daa4fe3ad83f3831c305bb736735bf795b284cb462c9e7\"\r\n    },\r\n    {ok, Result} = dev_snp_nif:compute_launch_digest(ArgsMap),\r\n    EncTestVector = <<\"Lhgbg_pneEf5Ebaj1ru3lIFu7RXHY4jBVnjSd-Yk7D0jIryZ3aLdks4YOWfjajKW\">>,\r\n    ?assertMatch(EncTestVector, hb_util:encode(Result)).\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis shows that the native code implements deterministic launch digest computation from a set of VM and software parameters.\r\n\r\n## Integration with HyperBEAM\r\n\r\n### Integration with Message System\r\n\r\nThe SNP system integrates with HyperBEAM's message system:\r\n\r\n1. **Message Attestation**: Creates signed attestation messages using `hb_message:attest`\r\n2. **Message Verification**: Verifies signatures and attestors using `hb_message:verify`\r\n3. **Message ID**: Uses `dev_message:id` to extract and verify node message IDs\r\n4. **Field Access**: Uses `hb_converge` for resolving fields in messages\r\n\r\n###

configuration to store and retrieve trusted software details\r\n\r\n### Integration with NIF System\r\n\r\nThe integration between Erlang and native code is managed through:\r\n\r\n1. **NIF Loading**: Uses `?load_nif_from_crate` to load the native library\r\n2. **Function Mapping**: Maps Erlang functions to native implementations\r\n3. **Data Conversion**: Handles data conversion between Erlang and native code\r\n4. **Error Handling**: Provides error handling for NIF failures\r\n\r\n## Testing Approach\r\n\r\nThe testing approach includes:\r\n\r\n1. **Conditional Testing**: Conditionally tests based on hardware support:\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   real_node_test() ->\r\n       if ?TEST_NODE == undefined ->\r\n           {skip, <<\"Test node not set.\">>};\r\n       true ->\r\n           % Test

file:read_file(\"test/snp-measurement.json\"),\r\n       ExpectedMeasurement = <</* binary data */>>\r\n       Result = dev_snp_nif:verify_measurement(MockReport, ExpectedMeasurement),\r\n       ?assertMatch({ok, true}, Result).\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n4. **Signature Verification**: Tests the verification of attestation report signatures:\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   verify_signature_test() ->\r\n       {ok, MockAttestation} = file:read_file(\"test/snp-attestation.json\"),\r\n       Result = dev_snp_nif:verify_signature(MockAttestation),\r\n       ?assertMatch({ok, true}, Result).\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n##

The comprehensive verification process, covering everything from nonce validation to software component verification, ensures robust security guarantees.\r\n\r\nWhile there are challenges related to hardware dependencies and complexity, the system provides significant value for security-sensitive applications. As confidential computing continues to grow in importance, components like the SNP system will likely become increasingly central to secure distributed systems.\r\n"
