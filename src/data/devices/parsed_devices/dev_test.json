Retrieves the current slot number from the input message\r\n2. Gets the list of previously seen slots from the state\r\n3. Logs the call details\r\n4. Returns an updated state with:\r\n   - A random key-value pair\r\n   - The current slot in the results\r\n   - An updated list of seen slots\r\n\r\n### Init Handler\r\n\r\nThe module provides an example initialization handler:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\ninit(Msg, _Msg2, Opts) ->\r\n    ?event({init_called_on_dev_test, Msg}),\r\n    {ok, hb_converge:set(Msg, #{ <<\"already-seen\">> => [] }, Opts)}.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis handler:\r\n1. Logs the initialization call\r\n2. Initializes the \"already-seen\" list to an empty list\r\n\r\n### Restore Handler\r\n\r\nAn example restore handler is included to demonstrate state restoration:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nrestore(Msg, _Msg2, Opts) ->\r\n    ?event({restore_called_on_dev_test, Msg}),\r\n    case hb_converge:get(<<\"already-seen\">>, Msg, Opts) of\r\n        not_found ->\r\n            ?event({restore_not_found, Msg}),\r\n            {error, <<\"No viable state to restore.\">>};\r\n        AlreadySeen ->\r\n            ?event({restore_found, AlreadySeen}),\r\n            {ok,\r\n                hb_private:set(\r\n                    Msg,\r\n                    #{ <<\"test-key/started-state\">> => AlreadySeen },\r\n                    Opts\r\n                )\r\n            }\r\n    end.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis handler:\r\n1. Logs the restore call\r\n2. Checks if the \"already-seen\" key exists in the state\r\n3. If not found, returns an error\r\n4. If found, saves the value to a private key and returns success\r\n\r\n### WASM-Compatible Function\r\n\r\nThe module includes a function that could be imported into a WebAssembly environment:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nmul(Msg1, Msg2) ->\r\n    ?event(mul_called),\r\n    State = hb_converge:get(<<\"state\">>, Msg1, #{ hashpath => ignore }),\r\n    [Arg1, Arg2] = hb_converge:get(<<\"args\">>, Msg2, #{ hashpath => ignore }),\r\n    ?event({mul_called, {state, State}, {args, [Arg1, Arg2]}}),\r\n    {ok, #{ <<\"state\">> => State, <<\"results\">> => [Arg1 * Arg2] }}.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function:\r\n1.

Logs the postprocess call\r\n2. Sets a flag in the HTTP server options to indicate that the postprocessor was called\r\n3. Returns the body messages unchanged\r\n\r\n## Integration with HyperBEAM\r\n\r\n### Integration with Converge System\r\n\r\nThe module is primarily designed to test and demonstrate the Converge system:\r\n\r\n1. **Function Resolution**: Tests the ability to resolve and call functions\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   hb_converge:resolve(Msg, test_func, #{})\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Message Manipulation**: Demonstrates proper message field access and modification\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   hb_converge:get(<<\"slot\">>, Msg2, Opts)\r\n   hb_converge:set(Msg1, #{ ... }, Opts)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. **Handler Pattern**: Implements the standard handler pattern expected by the device framework\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   {ok, UpdatedMessage}\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Integration with HTTP Server\r\n\r\nThe module includes integration with the HTTP server system:\r\n\r\n1. **Option Setting**: Sets options in the HTTP server\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   hb_http_server:set_opts(Opts#{ <<\"postprocessor-called\">> => true })\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Postprocessing**: Demonstrates the postprocessing pattern for HTTP responses\r\n\r\n### Integration with WASM System\r\n\r\nThe module shows integration with WebAssembly execution:\r\n\r\n1. **Importable Function**: Provides a function suitable for import into a WASM environment\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   mul(Msg1, Msg2) -> ...\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **State Handling**: Demonstrates state and argument handling pattern for WASM integration\r\n\r\n## Testing Approach\r\n\r\nThe module includes three EUNIT test functions:\r\n\r\n### Function Resolution Test\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\ndevice_with_function_key_module_test() ->\r\n    Msg =\r\n        #{\r\n            <<\"device\">> => <<\"Test-Device@1.0\">>\r\n        },\r\n    ?assertEqual(\r\n        {ok, <<\"GOOD_FUNCTION\">>},\r\n        hb_converge:resolve(Msg, test_func, #{})\r\n    ).\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis test verifies that:\r\n1. The Converge system can correctly resolve devices by name\r\n2. Functions exported by the device are callable through the resolution mechanism\r\n\r\n### Compute Handler Test\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\ncompute_test() ->\r\n    Msg0 = #{ <<\"device\">> => <<\"Test-Device@1.0\">> },\r\n    {ok, Msg1} = hb_converge:resolve(Msg0, init, #{}),\r\n    Msg2 =\r\n        hb_converge:set(\r\n            #{ <<\"path\">> => <<\"compute\">> },\r\n            #{\r\n                <<\"slot\">> => 1,\r\n                <<\"body/number\">> => 1337\r\n            },\r\n            #{}\r\n        ),\r\n    {ok, Msg3} = hb_converge:resolve(Msg1, Msg2, #{}),\r\n    ?assertEqual(1, hb_converge:get(<<\"results/assignment-slot\">>, Msg3, #{})),\r\n    % ... more test steps ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis test:\r\n1. Creates a device message\r\n2. Initializes the device\r\n3. Creates a compute message with a slot\r\n4. Resolves the compute message\r\n5. Verifies that the results contain the correct slot\r\n6. Repeats the process with a different slot\r\n7. Confirms that both slots are tracked in the \"already-seen\" list\r\n\r\n### Restore Handler Test\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nrestore_test() ->\r\n    Msg1 = #{ <<\"device\">> => <<\"Test-Device@1.0\">>, <<\"already-seen\">> => [1] },\r\n    {ok, Msg3} = hb_converge:resolve(Msg1, <<\"restore\">>, #{}),\r\n    ?assertEqual([1], hb_private:get(<<\"test-key/started-state\">>, Msg3, #{})).\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis test:\r\n1. Creates a device message with an \"already-seen\" list\r\n2. Calls the restore handler\r\n3. Verifies that the private state was set correctly\r\n\r\n## Observations and Insights\r\n\r\n### Strengths\r\n\r\n1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Provides examples for all major handler types in the device framework.\r\n\r\n2. **Clear Implementation Patterns**: Demonstrates clear patterns for implementing device behaviors.\r\n\r\n3. **Testing Integration**: Designed specifically with testing in mind, integrating well with the testing infrastructure.\r\n\r\n4. **Self-Validation**: Includes tests to validate its own functionality, serving as both example and test case.\r\n\r\n5. **Minimal Dependencies**: Relies only on core HyperBEAM components, making it robust against changes.\r\n\r\n### Design Patterns\r\n\r\n1. **Reference Implementation**: Serves as a reference for implementing device behaviors.\r\n\r\n2. **State Accumulation**: Demonstrates how to accumulate state across multiple calls.\r\n\r\n3. **Handler Delegation**: Shows how to delegate default behavior to another device.\r\n\r\n4. **Error Handling**: Includes examples of both success and error responses.\r\n\r\n5. **Private State Management**: Demonstrates the use of private state for internal tracking.\r\n\r\n### Challenges and Limitations\r\n\r\n1. **Test-Only Focus**: Only suitable for testing, not for production use.\r\n\r\n2. **Minimal Documentation**: Limited inline documentation about the overall design.\r\n\r\n3. **Simplified Implementations**: Implementations are simplified for testing purposes, not necessarily demonstrating best practices for production code.\r\n\r\n4. **Lack of Edge Cases**: Doesn't demonstrate handling of all possible edge cases.\r\n\r\n5. **HTTP Integration Simplicity**: The HTTP integration is very simplified compared to production requirements.\r\n\r\n### Future Opportunities\r\n\r\n1. **Expanded Test Coverage**: Adding more test cases to cover additional scenarios.\r\n\r\n2. **Enhanced Documentation**: Adding more detailed documentation about testing patterns.\r\n\r\n3. **Edge Case Handling**: Demonstrating handling of more edge cases and error conditions.\r\n\r\n4. **Performance Testing**: Adding examples for performance testing.\r\n\r\n5. **Integration Testing**: Expanding examples for integration testing with other components.\r\n\r\n## Architectural Significance\r\n\r\nThe module has several points of architectural significance:\r\n\r\n1. **Testing Infrastructure**: Forms part of the testing infrastructure for HyperBEAM.\r\n\r\n2. **Reference Implementation**: Provides a reference for how devices should behave.\r\n\r\n3. **Converge Validation**: Validates the core Converge resolution mechanism.\r\n\r\n4. **Integration Patterns**: Demonstrates integration patterns with various system components.\r\n\r\n5. **Handler Patterns**: Establishes patterns for implementing different handler types.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe `dev_test.erl` module serves as a valuable testing utility and reference implementation within HyperBEAM. While it's not intended for production use, it plays a crucial role in validating the core functionality of the Converge system and providing examples of proper device behavior implementation.\r\n\r\nThe module's comprehensive coverage of handler types, clear implementation patterns, and integration with testing frameworks make it an essential component for maintaining the quality and stability of the HyperBEAM system. Its design as a self-testing reference implementation provides developers with concrete examples to follow when implementing their own devices.\r\n\r\nAs HyperBEAM continues to evolve, this testing utility will likely remain an important tool for ensuring that core functionality remains intact and that developers have a clear understanding of proper implementation patterns.\r\n\r\n## TO-DO Comments and Incomplete Aspects\r\n\r\nThis module does not contain any explicit TO-DO comments, which suggests it is relatively complete and stable in its current form. However, some aspects that could be considered incomplete or candidates for future enhancement include:\r\n\r\n1. The `snapshot` handler implementation is minimal, returning only an empty map. This might be intentional for testing purposes, but a more robust implementation could provide better testing coverage.\r\n\r\n2. There is an implicit expectation that the `already-seen` list exists in several handlers, but the error handling for its absence is only implemented in the `restore` handler, not in the `compute` handler.\r\n\r\n3. The module is named \"Test-Device/1.0\", which suggests a versioning scheme, but there's no documentation about what might change in future versions or what backward compatibility guarantees exist.\r\n\r\n4. The `postprocess` handler mentions \"HTTP server\", but the integration is very limited, only setting a flag rather than demonstrating typical HTTP response patterns.\r\n\r\nThese points are not explicitly marked as TO-DO items but represent areas where the module could potentially be expanded or improved in the future.\r\n"
