As described in its documentation, it's \"a long-lived process worker that keeps state in memory between calls\" and \"implements the interface of `hb_converge` to receive and respond to computation requests regarding a process as a singleton.\"\r\n\r\nThis module is a critical optimization for process execution, providing in-memory state persistence between computation steps that would otherwise require loading state from disk for each operation. By keeping computation state in memory, it significantly reduces the overhead of repeated process invocations and enables efficient handling of sequential operations.\r\n\r\nThe implementation leverages Erlang's process model to create isolated workers for each HyperBEAM process, using the process ID as a grouping key. These workers maintain state until an idle timeout occurs, at which point they persist their state to disk before exiting, ensuring no state is lost.\r\n\r\n## Key Characteristics\r\n\r\n- **Long-Lived Workers**: Maintains state in memory between calls for efficient repeated computation\r\n- **Process-Based Grouping**: Creates separate workers for each process ID\r\n- **Wait and Notify Mechanism**: Coordinates multiple clients awaiting computation results\r\n- **Idle Timeout**: Automatically persists state and exits after a configurable period of inactivity\r\n- **Slot-Based Resolution**: Handles computation requests for specific slots within a process\r\n- **Integration with hb_persistent**: Extends the persistent worker pattern for process-specific needs\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n### Upstream Dependencies\r\n\r\n- `hb_persistent`: For default worker management behavior\r\n- `hb_path`: For path matching and manipulation\r\n- `hb_converge`: For message resolution and field access\r\n- `hb_message`: For message ID operations\r\n- `hb_util`: For utility functions\r\n- `hb_opts`: For configuration access\r\n- `dev_process`: For process-specific operations\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\n### Worker Grouping\r\n\r\nThe module determines which worker should handle a request through its `group/3` function:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\ngroup(Msg1, Msg2, Opts) ->\r\n    case hb_opts:get(process_workers, false, Opts) of\r\n        false ->\r\n            hb_persistent:default_grouper(Msg1, Msg2, Opts);\r\n        true ->\r\n            case Msg2 of\r\n                undefined ->\r\n                    hb_persistent:default_grouper(Msg1, undefined, Opts);\r\n                _ ->\r\n                    case hb_path:matches(<<\"compute\">>, hb_path:hd(Msg2, Opts)) of\r\n                        true ->\r\n                            process_to_group_name(Msg1, Opts);\r\n                        _ ->\r\n                            hb_persistent:default_grouper(Msg1, Msg2, Opts)\r\n                    end\r\n            end\r\n    end.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function:\r\n1. Checks if process workers are enabled\r\n2. If not, falls back to the default grouping behavior\r\n3. If enabled, checks if the request is for computation\r\n4. For computation requests, uses the process ID as the group name\r\n5. For other requests, falls back to the default grouping behavior\r\n\r\nThis ensures that all computation requests for the same process are handled by the same worker, maintaining state continuity.\r\n\r\n### Worker Server Loop\r\n\r\nThe worker maintains its state through a server loop:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nserver(GroupName, Msg1, Opts) ->\r\n    ServerOpts = Opts#{\r\n        await_inprogress => false,\r\n        spawn_worker => false,\r\n        process_workers => false\r\n    },\r\n    % The maximum amount of time the worker will wait for a request before\r\n    % checking the cache for a snapshot. Default: 5 minutes.\r\n    Timeout = hb_opts:get(process_worker_max_idle, 300_000, Opts),\r\n    receive\r\n        {resolve, Listener, GroupName, Msg2, ListenerOpts} ->\r\n            TargetSlot = hb_converge:get(<<\"slot\">>, Msg2, Opts),\r\n            Res =\r\n                hb_converge:resolve(\r\n                    Msg1,\r\n                    #{ <<\"path\">> => <<\"compute\">>, <<\"slot\">> => TargetSlot },\r\n                    maps:merge(ListenerOpts, ServerOpts)\r\n                ),\r\n            send_notification(Listener, GroupName, TargetSlot, Res),\r\n            server(\r\n                GroupName,\r\n                case Res of\r\n                    {ok, Msg3} -> Msg3;\r\n                    _ -> Msg1\r\n                end,\r\n                Opts\r\n            );\r\n        stop ->\r\n            exit(normal)\r\n    after Timeout ->\r\n        % We have hit the in-memory persistence timeout. Generate a snapshot\r\n        % of the current process state and ensure it is cached.\r\n        hb_converge:resolve(\r\n            Msg1,\r\n            <<\"snapshot\">>,\r\n            ServerOpts#{ <<\"cache-control\">> => [<<\"store\">>] }\r\n        ),\r\n        % Return the current process state.\r\n        {ok, Msg1}\r\n    end.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis loop:\r\n1. Waits for a computation request or a timeout\r\n2. For a request, performs the computation and updates its state\r\n3. Notifies listeners of computation completion\r\n4. Recurses with the updated state for the next request\r\n5. On timeout, creates a snapshot of the current state and exits\r\n\r\nThe timeout behavior is particularly important as it ensures state is not lost when a worker has been idle for too long, while still releasing resources.\r\n\r\n### Waiting for Results\r\n\r\nThe `await/5` function enables clients to wait for computation results:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nawait(Worker, GroupName, Msg1, Msg2, Opts) ->\r\n    case hb_path:matches(<<\"compute\">>, hb_path:hd(Msg2, Opts)) of\r\n        false -> \r\n            hb_persistent:default_await(Worker, GroupName, Msg1, Msg2, Opts);\r\n        true ->\r\n            TargetSlot = hb_converge:get(<<\"slot\">>, Msg2, any, Opts),\r\n            receive\r\n                {resolved, _, GroupName, {slot, RecvdSlot}, Res}\r\n                        when RecvdSlot == TargetSlot orelse TargetSlot == any ->\r\n                    Res;\r\n                {resolved, _, GroupName, {slot, RecvdSlot}, _Res} ->\r\n                    await(Worker, GroupName, Msg1, Msg2, Opts);\r\n                {'DOWN', _R, process, Worker, _Reason} ->\r\n                    {error, leader_died}\r\n            end\r\n    end.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function:\r\n1. Checks if the request is for computation\r\n2. If not, falls back to the default await behavior\r\n3. If it is, waits for a result with the matching slot number\r\n4. If it receives a result for a different slot, it continues waiting\r\n5. If the worker dies, it returns an error\r\n\r\nThis coordination mechanism allows multiple clients to request computations at different slots and efficiently receive their results.\r\n\r\n### Notifying Waiters\r\n\r\nThe worker uses the `notify_compute/4` function to inform waiting clients of computation results:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nnotify_compute(GroupName, SlotToNotify, Msg3, Opts) ->\r\n    notify_compute(GroupName, SlotToNotify, Msg3, Opts, 0).\r\nnotify_compute(GroupName, SlotToNotify, Msg3, Opts, Count) ->\r\n    receive\r\n        {resolve, Listener, GroupName, #{ <<\"slot\">> := SlotToNotify }, _ListenerOpts} ->\r\n            send_notification(Listener, GroupName, SlotToNotify, Msg3),\r\n            notify_compute(GroupName, SlotToNotify, Msg3, Opts, Count + 1);\r\n        {resolve, Listener, GroupName, Msg, _ListenerOpts}\r\n                when is_map(Msg) andalso not is_map_key(<<\"slot\">>, Msg) ->\r\n            send_notification(Listener, GroupName, SlotToNotify, Msg3),\r\n            notify_compute(GroupName, SlotToNotify, Msg3, Opts, Count + 1)\r\n    after 0 ->\r\n        % Finished notifying\r\n    end.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function:\r\n1. Collects any pending requests for the computed slot\r\n2. Notifies each waiting client with the result\r\n3. Continues until no more waiters are found\r\n4. Keeps track of how many clients were notified\r\n\r\nThis pattern allows for efficient distribution of results to multiple clients without recomputing the same slot.\r\n\r\n## Questions and Insights\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n\r\n1. **Worker Lifecycle Management**: How are workers recovered if they crash unexpectedly? Is there a supervisor or monitoring system?\r\n\r\n2. **Memory Management**: How does the system manage memory pressure if there are many active workers, each with potentially large state?\r\n\r\n3. **Coordination Across Nodes**: How do workers coordinate if the same process is being computed on multiple nodes?\r\n\r\n4. **Configuration Tuning**: What are the considerations for tuning the worker timeout value for different types of processes?\r\n\r\n5. **Concurrency Control**: How does the system prevent race conditions if multiple clients try to compute the same slot simultaneously?\r\n\r\n### Insights\r\n\r\n1. **Performance Optimization**: The in-memory worker pattern provides significant performance benefits by avoiding repeated state loading from disk.\r\n\r\n2. **Resource Management**: The idle timeout mechanism helps balance memory usage with performance by releasing resources from inactive workers.\r\n\r\n3. **Process Isolation**: Each process gets its own dedicated worker, providing isolation and preventing interference between processes.\r\n\r\n4. **Message-Passing Coordination**: The use of Erlang's message passing for coordination aligns well with the Erlang \"let it crash\" philosophy.\r\n\r\n5. **Flexible Grouping**: The conditional grouping behavior allows the system to use the persistent worker pattern only when appropriate.\r\n\r\n## Integration with Other Subsystems\r\n\r\n### Integration with Device and Process Management Subsystem\r\n\r\n- Works closely with `dev_process` for process-specific operations\r\n- Maintains in-memory state for efficient process computation\r\n- Coordinates computation results to multiple clients\r\n\r\n### Integration with Storage Subsystem\r\n\r\n- Creates snapshots that are persisted to storage on timeout\r\n- Initiates state recovery from storage when necessary\r\n\r\n### Integration with Core Infrastructure\r\n\r\n- Uses `hb_converge` for message resolution\r\n- Extends `hb_persistent` pattern for process-specific needs\r\n- Leverages Erlang's message passing for coordination\r\n\r\n## Recategorization Considerations\r\n\r\nThis module is correctly categorized as part of the Device and Process Management Subsystem. It specifically focuses on managing the lifecycle and state of process computations, which is a core aspect of process management.\r\n\r\nWhile it has elements of both storage (through snapshot persistence) and computation (through execution handling), its primary role is in maintaining the computational context for processes, making the Device and Process Management Subsystem its appropriate home.\r\n\r\nThe tight integration with `dev_process` and its focus on the computational aspects of process execution (rather than just storage or caching) further confirms its proper categorization.\r\n"
