Ensures the base is a process\r\n2. Checks if a slot is provided\r\n3. If no slot, schedules the message and processes based on type (Message or Process)\r\n4. If a slot is provided, pushes the message with the appropriate mode\r\n\r\n### Push Mode Selection\r\n\r\nThe module supports both synchronous and asynchronous pushing modes:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\npush_with_mode(Base, Req, Opts) ->\r\n    Mode = is_async(Base, Req, Opts),\r\n    case Mode of\r\n        <<\"sync\">> ->\r\n            do_push(Base, Req, Opts);\r\n        <<\"async\">> ->\r\n            spawn(fun() -> do_push(Base, Req, Opts) end)\r\n    end.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe mode is determined by checking various configuration sources:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nis_async(Base, Req, Opts) ->\r\n    hb_converge:get_first(\r\n        [\r\n            {Req, <<\"push-mode\">>},\r\n            {Base, <<\"push-mode\">>},\r\n            {Base, <<\"process/push-mode\">>}\r\n        ],\r\n        <<\"sync\">>,\r\n        Opts\r\n    ).\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Core Push Processing\r\n\r\nThe actual push processing occurs in the `do_push/3` function:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\ndo_push(Base, Assignment, Opts) ->\r\n    Slot = hb_converge:get(<<\"slot\">>, Assignment, Opts),\r\n    ID = dev_process:process_id(Base, #{}, Opts),\r\n    ?event(push, {push_computing_outbox, {process_id, ID}, {slot, Slot}}),\r\n    Result = hb_converge:resolve(\r\n        {as, <<\"process@1.0\">>, Base},\r\n        #{ <<\"path\">> => <<\"compute/results/outbox\">>, <<\"slot\">> => Slot },\r\n        Opts#{ hashpath => ignore }\r\n    ),\r\n    % ... process the results and push to downstream processes ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function:\r\n1. Retrieves the slot number and process ID\r\n2. Computes the outbox for the given slot\r\n3. For each message in the outbox, pushes it to the target process\r\n4. Collects and returns the results of all downstream pushes\r\n\r\n### Message Pushing Logic\r\n\r\nThe core message pushing logic is in `push_result_message/5`:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\npush_result_message(Base, FromSlot, Key, MsgToPush, Opts) ->\r\n    case hb_converge:get(<<\"target\">>, MsgToPush, undefined, Opts) of\r\n        undefined ->\r\n            ?event(push, {skip_no_target, {key, Key}, MsgToPush}, Opts),\r\n            #{};\r\n        TargetID ->\r\n            % ... schedule the message and push it to the target ...\r\n            case schedule_result(Base, MsgToPush, Opts) of\r\n                {ok, Assignment} ->\r\n                    % ... process the assignment and recursively push ...\r\n                    Resurse = hb_converge:resolve(\r\n                        {as, <<\"process@1.0\">>, TargetAsProcess},\r\n                        #{ <<\"path\">> => <<\"push\">>, <<\"slot\">> => NextSlotOnProc },\r\n                        Opts#{ cache_control => <<\"always\">> }\r\n                    ),\r\n                    % ... handle the results ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function:\r\n1. Checks if a target is specified\r\n2. If a target exists, schedules the message on the target process\r\n3. Recursively calls push on the target process with the new slot\r\n4. Returns the results of the recursive push\r\n\r\n### Message Scheduling\r\n\r\nThe module includes several functions for scheduling messages:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nschedule_result(Base, MsgToPush, Opts) ->\r\n    schedule_result(Base, MsgToPush, <<\"httpsig@1.0\">>, Opts).\r\nschedule_result(Base, MsgToPush, Codec, Opts) ->\r\n    % ... prepare and attest the message ...\r\n    SignedReq =\r\n        #{\r\n            <<\"method\">> => <<\"POST\">>,\r\n            <<\"path\">> => <<\"schedule\">>,\r\n            <<\"body\">> =>\r\n                SignedMsg = hb_message:attest(\r\n                    additional_keys(Base, MsgToPush, Opts),\r\n                    Opts,\r\n                    Codec\r\n                )\r\n        },\r\n    % ... resolve the request and handle the response ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese functions:\r\n1. Prepare the message with additional keys\r\n2. Attest the message using the specified codec\r\n3. Create a schedule request\r\n4. Resolve the request on the target process\r\n5. Handle the response, including potential redirects and format downgrades\r\n\r\n### Cross-Node Communication\r\n\r\nFor messages that need to be pushed to remote nodes, the module includes `remote_schedule_result/3`:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nremote_schedule_result(Location, SignedReq, Opts) ->\r\n    ?event(push, {remote_schedule_result, {location, Location}, {req, SignedReq}}, Opts),\r\n    {Node, RedirectPath} = parse_redirect(Location),\r\n    % ... prepare the request ...\r\n    % Store a copy of the message for ourselves.\r\n    hb_cache:write(SignedReq, Opts),\r\n    case hb_http:post(Node, Path, maps:without([<<\"path\">>], SignedReq), Opts) of\r\n        {ok, Res} ->\r\n            % ... handle the response ...\r\n        {error, Res} ->\r\n            {error, Res}\r\n    end.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function:\r\n1. Parses the redirect location to extract the node and path\r\n2. Stores a copy of the message in the local cache\r\n3. Posts the request to the remote node\r\n4. Handles the response, including potential further redirects\r\n\r\n## Integration with HyperBEAM\r\n\r\n### Integration with Process Management\r\n\r\nThe module integrates with HyperBEAM's process management system:\r\n\r\n1. **Process Conversion**: Uses `dev_process:as_process/2` to ensure a base is a process\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   ModBase = dev_process:as_process(Base, Opts)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Process ID Retrieval**: Uses `dev_process:process_id/3` to get the process ID\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   ID = dev_process:process_id(Base, #{}, Opts)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. **Process Key Handling**: Uses `dev_process:ensure_process_key/2` to ensure process keys are present\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   TargetAsProcess = dev_process:ensure_process_key(TargetBase, Opts)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Integration with Cache System\r\n\r\nThe module integrates with HyperBEAM's cache system:\r\n\r\n1. **Message Retrieval**: Uses `hb_cache:read/2` to retrieve messages\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   {ok, PushBase} = hb_cache:read(Target, Opts)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Message Storage**: Uses `hb_cache:write/2` to store messages\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   hb_cache:write(SignedReq, Opts)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Integration with HTTP System\r\n\r\nThe module integrates with HyperBEAM's HTTP system for remote operations:\r\n\r\n1. **Remote Posting**: Uses `hb_http:post/4` to send messages to remote nodes\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   hb_http:post(Node, Path, maps:without([<<\"path\">>], SignedReq), Opts)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Integration with Message System\r\n\r\nThe module integrates with HyperBEAM's message system:\r\n\r\n1. **Message Attestation**: Uses `hb_message:attest/3` to attest messages\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   SignedMsg = hb_message:attest(additional_keys(Base, MsgToPush, Opts), Opts, Codec)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Message Verification**: Uses `hb_message:verify/2` to verify messages\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   hb_message:verify(SignedMsg, signers)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. **Message ID Retrieval**: Uses `hb_message:id/3` to get message IDs\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   hb_message:id(FromMsg, all, Opts)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n## Testing Approach\r\n\r\nThe module includes several complex test functions:\r\n\r\n### Full Push Test\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nfull_push_test_() ->\r\n    {timeout, 30, fun() ->\r\n        % ... set up test environment ...\r\n        % Create a process\r\n        Msg1 = dev_process:test_aos_process(Opts),\r\n        % Schedule a ping-pong script on it\r\n        Script = ping_pong_script(2),\r\n        {ok, Msg2} = dev_process:schedule_aos_call(Msg1, Script),\r\n        % Push the script and verify execution\r\n        {ok, StartingMsgSlot} =\r\n            hb_converge:resolve(Msg2, #{ <<\"path\">> => <<\"slot\">> }, Opts),\r\n        Msg3 =\r\n            #{\r\n                <<\"path\">> => <<\"push\">>,\r\n                <<\"slot\">> => StartingMsgSlot\r\n            },\r\n        {ok, _} = hb_converge:resolve(Msg1, Msg3, Opts),\r\n        % Check the final result\r\n        ?assertEqual(\r\n            {ok, <<\"Done.\">>},\r\n            hb_converge:resolve(Msg1, <<\"now/results/data\">>, Opts)\r\n        )\r\n    end}.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis test:\r\n1.

Verifies that the expected error occurs due to format issues\r\n\r\nThe module also includes disabled tests for multi-process pushing and pushing with redirect hints, which provide additional test coverage but are not currently active.\r\n\r\n## Observations and Insights\r\n\r\n### Strengths\r\n\r\n1. **Versatile Communication**: Provides a flexible mechanism for cross-process communication both locally and remotely.\r\n\r\n2. **Recursive Propagation**: Enables complex message chains through recursive message pushing.\r\n\r\n3. **Format Negotiation**: Supports multiple message formats with automatic downgrading for compatibility.\r\n\r\n4. **Sync/Async Modes**: Offers both synchronous and asynchronous execution modes for different use cases.\r\n\r\n5. **Comprehensive Logging**: Includes detailed event logging for debugging and monitoring message flow.\r\n\r\n### Design Patterns\r\n\r\n1. **Recursive Chain Pattern**: Implements recursive message chains for propagating messages through multiple processes.\r\n\r\n2. **Format Negotiation Pattern**: Uses a fallback mechanism to try different formats when the preferred one fails.\r\n\r\n3. **Async Processing Pattern**: Provides an option for asynchronous message pushing through process spawning.\r\n\r\n4. **Idempotency Pattern**: Ensures messages are uniquely identified and can be safely retried.\r\n\r\n5. **Redirect Handling Pattern**: Implements proper handling of HTTP redirects for remote operations.\r\n\r\n### Challenges and Limitations\r\n\r\n1. **Complex Error Handling**: The error handling logic is complex and spread across multiple functions.\r\n\r\n2. **Network Dependency**: Heavily relies on network communication for remote pushing, which can introduce latency and reliability issues.\r\n\r\n3. **Test Fragility**: Some tests are disabled due to potential issues, indicating fragility in the testing approach.\r\n\r\n4. **Format Dependency**: Requires specific message formats, which can limit interoperability with external systems.\r\n\r\n5. **Remote Node Trust**: Limited validation of remote nodes, potentially allowing security issues in untrusted environments.\r\n\r\n### Future Opportunities\r\n\r\n1. **Enhanced Error Recovery**: Adding more sophisticated error recovery mechanisms for network failures.\r\n\r\n2. **Improved Format Negotiation**: Expanding format negotiation to handle more formats and be more flexible.\r\n\r\n3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimizing the recursive pushing logic to reduce latency in long message chains.\r\n\r\n4. **Security Enhancements**: Adding more rigorous validation of remote nodes and messages.\r\n\r\n5. **Monitoring and Metrics**: Adding more comprehensive monitoring and metrics for message flow.\r\n\r\n## Architectural Significance\r\n\r\nThe module has several points of architectural significance:\r\n\r\n1. **Distributed Communication**: Enables distributed communication patterns across multiple processes and nodes.\r\n\r\n2. **Message Propagation**: Provides a crucial mechanism for message propagation in a distributed system.\r\n\r\n3. **Cross-Node Interoperability**: Facilitates interoperability between different nodes in a network.\r\n\r\n4. **State Distribution**: Enables distributed state updates through message passing.\r\n\r\n5. **Event Chaining**: Allows for event chaining across multiple processes and nodes.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe `dev_push.erl` module is a sophisticated component of HyperBEAM's messaging architecture, enabling complex distributed communication patterns through recursive message propagation. Its support for both local and remote pushing, synchronous and asynchronous modes, and multiple message formats makes it a versatile tool for building distributed applications.\r\n\r\nWhile the module's complexity introduces challenges in terms of error handling, testing, and maintenance, its comprehensive design provides a solid foundation for distributed message passing. The integration with HyperBEAM's process, cache, HTTP, and message systems creates a cohesive framework for secure, reliable communication in a distributed environment.\r\n\r\nAs HyperBEAM continues to evolve, this push mechanism will likely remain a critical component for enabling complex distributed workflows, cross-node communication, and event-driven architectures. Future improvements in error handling, format negotiation, and security will further enhance its utility in distributed systems.\r\n\r\n## TO-DO Comments and Incomplete Aspects\r\n\r\nThis module contains a few explicit and implicit TODO items and incomplete aspects:\r\n\r\n1. There's a TODO comment in the `add_attestations` function:\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   % TODO: Filter out attestations from the current node.\r\n   ```\r\n   This suggests the current implementation may include redundant attestations from the local node.\r\n\r\n2. There's a note about an incomplete test case:\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   % Note: This test currently only gets a reply that the message was not\r\n   % trusted by the process. To fix this, we would have to add another \r\n   % trusted authority to the `test_aos_process' call.\r\n   ```\r\n   This indicates that the `push_with_redirect_hint_test_disabled` test is incomplete and requires additional setup to fully test the functionality.\r\n\r\n3. Several test functions are explicitly disabled (`push_with_redirect_hint_test_disabled` and `multi_process_push_test_disabled`), suggesting there are aspects of the functionality that cannot be reliably tested in the current implementation.\r\n\r\n4. There's a comment about potential enhancements to attestation handling:\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   ?no_prod(\"Currently we only attest to the outbox and spawn items. Make it general?\")\r\n   ```\r\n   This indicates a design consideration about whether the attestation mechanism should be generalized to handle more message types.\r\n\r\nThese items represent potential areas for improvement in future versions of the module, particularly around testing reliability, attestation handling, and optimizations for duplicate attestation filtering.\r\n"
