As described in its documentation, it serves as \"a simple registry for local services in AO, using pg,\" with a current focus on scheduler processes (referred to as \"SU processes\" in the code comments).\r\n\r\nThis module provides a centralized mechanism for mapping between process IDs (which are typically content-addressed identifiers) and the actual Erlang processes that handle these identifiers. It also offers process creation capabilities when requested processes don't exist, making it both a registry and a factory for scheduler processes.\r\n\r\nThe registry uses the `hb_name` service, which provides a distributed naming capability, enabling processes to be located across the system. This is essential for the distributed nature of HyperBEAM operations.\r\n\r\n## Key Characteristics\r\n\r\n- **Process Registration**: Maps between process IDs and Erlang PIDs\r\n- **Process Discovery**: Enables lookup of running scheduler processes\r\n- **Process Creation**: Can optionally create processes that don't exist\r\n- **Wallet Management**: Provides access to the wallet used for scheduler operations\r\n- **Process Enumeration**: Supports listing all registered processes\r\n- **Naming Service Integration**: Uses `hb_name` for distributed process registration\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n### Upstream Dependencies\r\n\r\n- `hb_name`: For process registration and lookup\r\n- `hb`: For wallet access\r\n- `dev_scheduler_server`: For starting new scheduler processes\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\n### Registry Initialization\r\n\r\nThe module initializes the registry system by starting the naming service:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nstart() ->\r\n    hb_name:start(),\r\n    ok.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis ensures that the underlying name service is available for process registration and lookup.\r\n\r\n### Process Lookup\r\n\r\nThe module provides a set of overloaded `find` functions for looking up processes:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nfind(ProcID) -> find(ProcID, false).\r\nfind(ProcID, GenIfNotHosted) ->\r\n    find(ProcID, GenIfNotHosted, #{ priv_wallet => hb:wallet() }).\r\nfind(ProcID, GenIfNotHosted, Opts) ->\r\n    case hb_name:lookup({dev_scheduler, ProcID}) of\r\n        undefined -> maybe_new_proc(ProcID, GenIfNotHosted, Opts);\r\n        Pid -> Pid\r\n    end.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese functions attempt to find a process by its ID, with the option to create a new process if one doesn't exist. The `GenIfNotHosted` parameter controls whether a new process should be created when not found:\r\n- When `GenIfNotHosted` is `false`, the function returns `not_found` for non-existent processes\r\n- When `GenIfNotHosted` is `true`, it creates a new process via `dev_scheduler_server:start/2`\r\n\r\nThe lookup is performed using the `hb_name:lookup/1` function, with process IDs prefixed with `dev_scheduler` to create a namespaced identifier.\r\n\r\n### Process Creation\r\n\r\nThe `maybe_new_proc/3` function handles the conditional creation of new processes:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nmaybe_new_proc(_ProcID, false, _Opts) -> not_found;\r\nmaybe_new_proc(ProcID, _GenIfNotHosted, Opts) -> \r\n    dev_scheduler_server:start(ProcID, Opts).\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function either returns `not_found` or delegates to `dev_scheduler_server:start/2` to create a new scheduler process for the given ID.\r\n\r\n### Process Enumeration\r\n\r\nThe `get_processes/0` function retrieves a list of all registered process IDs:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nget_processes() ->\r\n    ?event({getting_processes, hb_name:all()}),\r\n    [ ProcID || {{dev_scheduler, ProcID}, _} <- hb_name:all() ].\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function filters the complete set of registered names from `hb_name:all()` to extract only those that are prefixed with `dev_scheduler`, returning just the process IDs.\r\n\r\n### Wallet Access\r\n\r\nThe `get_wallet/0` function provides access to the wallet used for authentication:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nget_wallet() ->\r\n    % TODO: We might want to use a different wallet per SU later.\r\n    hb:wallet().\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs noted in the code comment, there's a consideration for potentially using different wallets per scheduler unit in the future.\r\n\r\n## Questions and Insights\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n\r\n1. **Scalability Considerations**: How does the registry handle scenarios with a large number of processes? Are there any performance bottlenecks in the lookup or enumeration operations?\r\n\r\n2. **Wallet Isolation**: The comment about potentially using different wallets per scheduler unit suggests a security or isolation consideration. What are the implications of using a single wallet versus multiple wallets?\r\n\r\n3. **Process Lifecycle Management**: How are process terminations handled in the registry? Is there a mechanism to clean up entries for processes that have ended?\r\n\r\n4. **Distributed Registry**: How does the registry behave in a distributed environment with multiple nodes? How is consistency maintained across nodes?\r\n\r\n5. **Lookup Performance**: Are there any optimizations for frequent lookups of the same process ID? Is there any caching mechanism?\r\n\r\n### Insights\r\n\r\n1. **Centralized Discovery**: The registry provides a centralized point of discovery for scheduler processes, simplifying the interaction model for other components that need to work with these processes.\r\n\r\n2. **Factory Pattern**: The module implements a factory pattern through its conditional process creation capability, combining discovery and creation in a convenient interface.\r\n\r\n3. **Simple Interface**: The API is designed to be straightforward, with sensible defaults and overloaded functions to accommodate different use cases.\r\n\r\n4. **Naming Convention**: The use of a consistent prefix (`dev_scheduler`) for registered processes creates a namespace that allows for easy filtering and organization.\r\n\r\n5. **Testing Focus**: The comprehensive test suite indicates a focus on reliability, covering different scenarios including non-existent processes, process creation, and enumeration.\r\n\r\n## Integration with Other Subsystems\r\n\r\n### Integration with Device and Process Management Subsystem\r\n\r\n- Serves as a critical component for the scheduler subsystem, enabling process discovery and creation\r\n- Works closely with `dev_scheduler_server` to instantiate new scheduler processes\r\n- Provides the wallet access needed for scheduler operations\r\n\r\n### Integration with Core Infrastructure\r\n\r\n- Uses `hb_name` for process registration and lookup\r\n- Relies on `hb` for wallet access\r\n\r\n## Recategorization Considerations\r\n\r\nThis module is correctly categorized as part of the Device and Process Management Subsystem. Its primary responsibility is managing the lifecycle and discovery of scheduler processes, which is a fundamental aspect of process management.\r\n\r\nThe module's tight integration with `dev_scheduler_server` and its focus on process mapping and creation align it firmly with the process management domain. While it depends on core infrastructure components like `hb_name`, its purpose is specifically to support the process management aspects of the system.\r\n\r\nThe registry pattern implemented by this module is a common design pattern in distributed systems, particularly for service discovery and lifecycle management. This further reinforces its categorization as a process management component rather than an infrastructure or utility component.\r\n"
