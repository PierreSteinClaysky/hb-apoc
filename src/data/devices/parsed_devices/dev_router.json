Getting the current routes via HTTP GET\r\n2. Adding a new route via HTTP POST (if properly attested)\r\n3. Maintaining routes in priority order for deterministic matching\r\n\r\n### Route Matching and Selection\r\n\r\nThe module implements a multi-stage process for selecting a route:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nroute(_, Msg, Opts) ->\r\n    Routes = hb_opts:get(routes, [], Opts),\r\n    R = match_routes(Msg, Routes, Opts),\r\n    case (R =/= no_matches) andalso hb_converge:get(<<\"node\">>, R, Opts) of\r\n        false -> {error, no_matches};\r\n        Node when is_binary(Node) -> {ok, Node};\r\n        Node when is_map(Node) -> apply_route(Msg, Node);\r\n        not_found ->\r\n            ModR = apply_routes(Msg, R, Opts),\r\n            case hb_converge:get(<<\"strategy\">>, R, Opts) of\r\n                not_found -> {ok, ModR};\r\n                <<\"All\">> -> {ok, ModR};\r\n                Strategy ->\r\n                    ChooseN = hb_converge:get(<<\"choose\">>, R, 1, Opts),\r\n                    Hashpath = hb_path:from_message(hashpath, R),\r\n                    Nodes = hb_converge:get(<<\"nodes\">>, ModR, Opts),\r\n                    Chosen = choose(ChooseN, Strategy, Hashpath, Nodes, Opts),\r\n                    handle_chosen_nodes(Chosen, Opts)\r\n            end\r\n    end.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis process:\r\n1. Finds a matching route based on message content\r\n2. Handles different route types (direct node, node map, or multiple nodes)\r\n3. Applies load distribution strategies when multiple nodes are available\r\n4. Generates the appropriate URI for the chosen route\r\n\r\n### Load Distribution Strategies\r\n\r\nThe module implements several strategies for distributing load across multiple nodes:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nchoose(N, <<\"Random\">>, _, Nodes, _Opts) ->\r\n    Node = lists:nth(rand:uniform(length(Nodes)), Nodes),\r\n    [Node | choose(N - 1, <<\"Random\">>, nop, lists:delete(Node, Nodes), _Opts)];\r\nchoose(N, <<\"By-Base\">>, Hashpath, Nodes, Opts) when is_binary(Hashpath) ->\r\n    choose(N, <<\"By-Base\">>, binary_to_bignum(Hashpath), Nodes, Opts);\r\nchoose(N, <<\"By-Base\">>, HashInt, Nodes, Opts) ->\r\n    Node = lists:nth((HashInt rem length(Nodes)) + 1, Nodes),\r\n    [Node | recursive_choose_remaining()];\r\nchoose(N, <<\"Nearest\">>, HashPath, Nodes, Opts) ->\r\n    BareHashPath = hb_util:native_id(HashPath),\r\n    NodesWithDistances = calculate_distances(Nodes, BareHashPath, Opts),\r\n    select_nodes_by_distance(NodesWithDistances, N);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese strategies include:\r\n1. **Random**: Non-deterministic, statistically even distribution\r\n2. **By-Base**: Deterministic routing based on message hashpath (ensuring messages with the same hashpath go to the same node)\r\n3. **Nearest**: Routing based on the \"distance\" between node wallet addresses and message hashpath\r\n\r\n### Path Transformation\r\n\r\nThe module supports various path transformations for routing:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\napply_route(#{ <<\"path\">> := Path }, #{ <<\"prefix\">> := Prefix }) ->\r\n    {ok, <<Prefix/binary, Path/binary>>};\r\napply_route(#{ <<\"path\">> := Path }, #{ <<\"suffix\">> := Suffix }) ->\r\n    {ok, <<Path/binary, Suffix/binary>>};\r\napply_route(#{ <<\"path\">> := Path }, #{ <<\"match\">> := Match, <<\"with\">> := With }) ->\r\n    % Apply the regex to the path and replace the first occurrence.\r\n    case re:replace(Path, Match, With, [global]) of\r\n        NewPath when is_binary(NewPath) ->\r\n            {ok, NewPath};\r\n        _ -> {error, invalid_replace_args}\r\n    end.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese transformations allow:\r\n1. Adding prefixes to paths\r\n2. Adding suffixes to paths\r\n3. Applying regex-based replacements to paths\r\n\r\n## Integration with HyperBEAM\r\n\r\n### Integration with Message System\r\n\r\nThe Router Device is deeply integrated with HyperBEAM's message system:\r\n\r\n1. **Message Matching**: Uses `hb_message:match` to match messages against templates\r\n2. **Path Handling**: Uses `hb_path` for path operations and regex matching\r\n3. **Field Access**: Uses `hb_converge` for message field access and resolution\r\n4. **Attestation Verification**: Uses `dev_message` to extract attestors for security\r\n\r\n### Integration with Configuration System\r\n\r\nThe module integrates with HyperBEAM's configuration system:\r\n\r\n1. **Route Storage**: Stores routes in the node's configuration\r\n2. **Configuration Access**: Uses `hb_opts` to access configuration values\r\n3. **Configuration Updates**: Uses `hb_http_server:set_opts` to update configuration\r\n4. **Security Configuration**: Uses configuration for authorization controls\r\n\r\n### Integration with HTTP System\r\n\r\nThe module facilitates HTTP-based interaction with the routing system:\r\n\r\n1. **HTTP Methods**: Supports GET for retrieving routes and POST for adding routes\r\n2. **URI Generation**: Generates proper URIs for HTTP routing\r\n3. **HTTP Routing**: Ensures messages can be routed to HTTP endpoints\r\n\r\n## Testing Approach\r\n\r\nThe module includes comprehensive testing:\r\n\r\n1. **Strategy Testing**: Tests for each load distribution strategy\r\n2. **Statistical Testing**: Ensures statistical properties of load distribution\r\n3. **Determinism Testing**: Verifies deterministic behavior for the By-Base strategy\r\n4. **Template Matching**: Tests message template matching\r\n5. **Regex Matching**: Tests path regex matching\r\n6. **Explicit Routing**: Tests explicit HTTP/HTTPS URL routing\r\n7. **Device Integration**: Tests integration with the TABM/Converge system\r\n8. **Route Management**: Tests for getting and adding routes\r\n\r\nThe tests are particularly thorough for the load distribution strategies, ensuring they behave as expected statistically.\r\n\r\n## Observations and Insights\r\n\r\n### Strengths\r\n\r\n1. **Flexible Routing**: The combination of template matching, path transformations, and load distribution strategies provides exceptional flexibility.\r\n\r\n2. **Statistical Balance**: The careful design of load distribution strategies ensures balanced distribution while maintaining determinism when needed.\r\n\r\n3. **Priority-Based Matching**: The priority ordering of routes enables predictable and controllable routing behavior.\r\n\r\n4. **Security Model**: The attestation-based security model ensures only authorized parties can modify routing configuration.\r\n\r\n5. **Path Transformation**: The support for path transformations enables adaptation to different endpoint requirements without changing message content.\r\n\r\n### Design Patterns\r\n\r\n1. **Priority-Ordered Routes**: Routes are maintained in priority order for deterministic matching.\r\n\r\n2. **Template Matching**: Messages are matched against templates for routing determination.\r\n\r\n3. **Strategy Pattern**: Different load distribution strategies are implemented as separate code paths.\r\n\r\n4. **Transformation Pipeline**: Path transformations form a pipeline of potential modifications.\r\n\r\n5. **Security by Attestation**: The module leverages cryptographic attestation to enforce security controls.\r\n\r\n### Challenges and Limitations\r\n\r\n1. **Configuration Size**: As the number of routes grows, managing and prioritizing them could become complex.\r\n\r\n2. **Dynamic Routing**: The current model is largely static;
