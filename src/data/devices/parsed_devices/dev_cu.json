Takes a message and a state map containing an assignment and logger\r\n2. Logs the pushing of a message with assignment and message IDs\r\n3. Calls `hb_client:compute/2` to execute the computation remotely\r\n4. Updates the state with the computation results or throws an error if computation fails\r\n\r\n### Computation Execution\r\n\r\nThe module provides a mechanism for executing computations and handling their results:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nexecute(CarrierMsg, S) ->\r\n    MaybeBundle = ar_bundles:hd(CarrierMsg),\r\n    Store = hb_opts:get(store),\r\n    Wallet = hb:wallet(),\r\n    {ok, Results} =\r\n        case MaybeBundle of\r\n            #tx{data = #{ <<\"body\">> := _Msg, <<\"assignment\">> := Assignment }} ->\r\n                % TODO: Execute without needing to call the SU unnecessarily.\r\n                {_, ProcID} = lists:keyfind(<<\"process\">>, 1, Assignment#tx.tags),\r\n                ?event({dev_cu_computing_from_full_assignment, {process, ProcID}, {slot, hb_util:id(Assignment, signed)}}),\r\n                hb_process:result(ProcID, hb_util:id(Assignment, signed), Store, Wallet);\r\n            _ ->\r\n                case lists:keyfind(<<\"process\">>, 1, CarrierMsg#tx.tags) of\r\n                    {_, Process} ->\r\n                        {_, Slot} = lists:keyfind(<<\"slot\">>, 1, CarrierMsg#tx.tags),\r\n                        ?event({dev_cu_computing_from_slot_ref, {process, Process}, {slot, Slot}}),\r\n                        hb_process:result(Process, Slot, Store, Wallet);\r\n                    false ->\r\n                        {error, no_viable_computation}\r\n                end\r\n        end,\r\n    % Additional attestation handling...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function:\r\n1. Extracts a potential bundle from the carrier message\r\n2. Retrieves the store configuration and wallet information\r\n3. Uses two different strategies to get computation results:\r\n   - From a full assignment included in the bundle\r\n   - From process and slot references in the carrier message tags\r\n4. Logs detailed events about the computation source\r\n5. Calls `hb_process:result/4` to retrieve the computation results\r\n\r\n### Attestation Handling\r\n\r\nThe module supports generating attestations for specific computation results:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\n{ResType, ModState = #{ results := _ModResults }} =\r\n    case lists:keyfind(<<\"attest-to\">>, 1, CarrierMsg#tx.tags) of\r\n        {_, RawAttestTo} ->\r\n            AttestTo = hb_util:decode(RawAttestTo),\r\n            ?event({attest_to_only_message, RawAttestTo}),\r\n            case ar_bundles:find(AttestTo, Results) of\r\n                not_found ->\r\n                    ?event(message_to_attest_to_not_found),\r\n                    {ok,\r\n                        S#{\r\n                            results =>\r\n                                #tx {\r\n                                    tags = [{<<\"status\">>, 404}],\r\n                                    data = <<\"Requested message to attest to not in results bundle.\">>\r\n                                }\r\n                        }\r\n                    };\r\n                _ ->\r\n                    ?event(message_to_attest_to_found),\r\n                    {ok, S#{\r\n                        results => ar_bundles:sign_item(\r\n                            #tx {\r\n                                tags = [\r\n                                    {<<\"status\">>, 200},\r\n                                    {<<\"attestation-for\">>, RawAttestTo}\r\n                                ],\r\n                                data = <<>>\r\n                            },\r\n                            hb:wallet()\r\n                        )\r\n                    }}\r\n            end;\r\n        false ->\r\n            {ok, S#{ results => Results }}\r\n    end,\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis section:\r\n1. Checks for an `attest-to` tag in the carrier message\r\n2. If present, attempts to find the specified message in the results bundle\r\n3. If found, signs a new item with a reference to the attested message\r\n4. If not found, returns a 404 status message\r\n5. If no attestation is requested, simply returns the computation results\r\n\r\n## Integration with HyperBEAM\r\n\r\n### Integration with Client System\r\n\r\nThe module integrates with HyperBEAM's client system through:\r\n\r\n1. **Remote Computation**: Uses `hb_client:compute/2` to delegate computation to remote nodes\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   hb_client:compute(Assignment, Msg)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **State Management**: Maintains computation state and results\r\n\r\n### Integration with Process System\r\n\r\nThe module integrates with HyperBEAM's process system through:\r\n\r\n1. **Result Retrieval**: Uses `hb_process:result/4` to retrieve computation results\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   hb_process:result(ProcID, hb_util:id(Assignment, signed), Store, Wallet)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Process Identification**: Extracts process IDs from assignments and message tags\r\n\r\n### Integration with Bundle System\r\n\r\nThe module integrates with HyperBEAM's bundle system through:\r\n\r\n1. **Bundle Extraction**: Uses `ar_bundles:hd/1` to extract the first item from a bundle\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   MaybeBundle = ar_bundles:hd(CarrierMsg)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Item Finding**: Uses `ar_bundles:find/2` to locate specific items in a bundle\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   ar_bundles:find(AttestTo, Results)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. **Item Signing**: Uses `ar_bundles:sign_item/2` to sign attestations\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   ar_bundles:sign_item(#tx{...}, hb:wallet())\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n## Testing Approach\r\n\r\nThe module includes EUNIT integration for testing:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\n-include_lib(\"eunit/include/eunit.hrl\").\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, no explicit test functions are defined within the module, suggesting that testing for this module may be:\r\n1.
