Checks if the operation is preprocessing (`pre`) or postprocessing (`post`)\r\n2. For preprocessing, determines if the request is from an allowlisted user\r\n3. Returns a cost of 0 for allowed users or \"infinity\" for denied users\r\n4. Always allows postprocessing (cost of 0) since access was already verified at preprocessing\r\n\r\n### Signer Verification\r\n\r\nThe module verifies that all signers of a message are in the allowlist:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\nis_admissible(Msg, NodeMsg) ->\r\n    AllowList = hb_opts:get(faff_allow_list, [], NodeMsg),\r\n    Req = hb_converge:get(<<\"request\">>, Msg, NodeMsg),\r\n    Signers =\r\n        lists:filtermap(\r\n            fun(Signer) when not ?IS_ID(Signer) -> false;\r\n               (Signer) -> {true, hb_util:human_id(Signer)}\r\n            end,\r\n            hb_converge:get(<<\"attestors\">>, Req, undefined, NodeMsg)\r\n        ),\r\n    ?event(payment, {is_admissible, {signers, Signers}, {allow_list, AllowList}}),\r\n    lists:all(\r\n        fun(Signer) -> lists:member(Signer, AllowList) end,\r\n        Signers\r\n    ).\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function:\r\n1. Retrieves the configured allowlist from node options\r\n2. Extracts the original request from the message\r\n3. Normalizes all signer addresses to human-readable format\r\n4. Verifies that every signer is present in the allowlist\r\n\r\n### Ledger Operations\r\n\r\nThe module implements a minimal ledger operation:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\ndebit(_, Req, _NodeMsg) ->\r\n    ?event(payment, {debit, Req}),\r\n    {ok, true}.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function:\r\n1. Logs the debit request for debugging\r\n2. Always returns success (`true`) without actually debiting anything\r\n3. Matches the ledger API required by the payment system\r\n\r\n## Integration with HyperBEAM\r\n\r\n### Integration with Payment System\r\n\r\nThe module integrates with HyperBEAM's payment system (`dev_p4.erl`) by implementing:\r\n\r\n1. **Pricing Interface**: Through the `estimate/3` function, which determines if a request is serviceable and at what cost\r\n2. **Ledger Interface**: Through the `debit/3` function, which simulates a debit operation\r\n\r\nThis allows it to be used as both:\r\n- A pricing device (`p4_pricing_device` setting)\r\n- A ledger device (`p4_ledger_device` setting)\r\n\r\n### Integration with Configuration System\r\n\r\nThe module integrates with HyperBEAM's configuration system through:\r\n\r\n1. **Allowlist Configuration**: Uses `hb_opts:get(faff_allow_list, [], NodeMsg)` to retrieve the configured allowlist\r\n2. **No Configuration Updates**: Unlike other devices, it doesn't modify configuration, only reads it\r\n\r\nThis keeps the module simple and focused on its access control role.\r\n\r\n### Integration with Message System\r\n\r\nThe module integrates with HyperBEAM's message system through:\r\n\r\n1. **Attestor Verification**: Examines message attestors to determine if they're allowlisted\r\n2. **Message Type Handling**: Distinguishes between preprocessing and postprocessing messages\r\n\r\nThis leverages HyperBEAM's attestation system for authentication.\r\n\r\n## Testing Approach\r\n\r\nWhile the module doesn't contain explicit tests, it's used in tests for other modules:\r\n\r\n1. **Payment System Tests**: Used in `dev_p4.erl` tests to demonstrate payment integration:\r\n   ```erlang\r\n   faff_test() ->\r\n       GoodWallet = ar_wallet:new(),\r\n       BadWallet = ar_wallet:new(),\r\n       Node = hb_http_server:start_node(\r\n          test_opts(\r\n               #{\r\n                   faff_allow_list =>\r\n                       [hb_util:human_id(ar_wallet:to_address(GoodWallet))]\r\n               }\r\n           )\r\n       ),\r\n       % Test allowed and denied access\r\n       % ...\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nThis test configuration demonstrates how to set up the module with an allowlist and test its access control behavior.\r\n\r\n## Observations and Insights\r\n\r\n### Strengths\r\n\r\n1. **Simplicity**: The module is extremely simple and focused, making it easy to understand and maintain.\r\n\r\n2. **Practical Utility**: Despite its simplicity, it provides a useful access control mechanism for private nodes.\r\n\r\n3. **Educational Value**: Serves as a clear example of how to implement pricing and ledger interfaces.\r\n\r\n4. **Zero-Cost Model**: The zero-cost model simplifies usage for allowed users while still providing access control.\r\n\r\n5. **Minimal Implementation**: Implements only what's needed, avoiding unnecessary complexity.\r\n\r\n### Design Patterns\r\n\r\n1. **Allowlist Pattern**: Uses a simple allowlist for access control, a common pattern in security systems.\r\n\r\n2. **Interface Implementation**: Implements just enough of the required interfaces to be functional.\r\n\r\n3. **Phase-Specific Logic**: Applies different logic based on the processing phase (pre vs. post).\r\n\r\n4. **Multi-Signer Verification**: Checks all signers rather than just one, enhancing security.\r\n\r\n5. **Default Denial**: Uses a default-deny approach, where access is only granted explicitly.\r\n\r\n### Challenges and Limitations\r\n\r\n1. **Manual Allowlist Management**: Requires manual management of the allowlist, which could become cumbersome for larger lists.\r\n\r\n2. **No Dynamic Updates**: Doesn't provide a mechanism to update the allowlist without restarting the node.\r\n\r\n3. **No Partial Access**: It's an all-or-nothing approach;
